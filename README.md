# Subjective Localization Data Extraction from VR Gameplay Using Non-Individualized HRTFs

“TP-T Sound” is an analysis tool which is also a video game, built in Unity, that looks at the subject’s head rotation to give accurate data about the process of localizing a sound in a 360 degree sphere. In this game the subjects are asked to locate a series of sounds that are randomly placed in a sphere around their heads using generalized HRTFs.
